Because of the laboriousness of the translation process, since the 1940s efforts have been made.
With varying degrees of success, to automate translation or to mechanically aid the human translator.
More recently, the rise of the Internet has fostered a world-wide 
market for translation services and has facilitated "language localization".
Ideally, the translator must know both languages, as well as the subject that is to be translated.
Being human makes us susceptible to the onset of feelings.
The role of these emotions varies. 
Some of them are useful while others may be harmful.
The use of social media for self-expression has reached a point that it makes us feel we can say anything.
This begins when we see people expressing anything and everything that come to mind.
When we see everyone else voicing their likes and dislikes, their irritations and desires we tend to imitate what they do.
And because many engage in this, we think that it is normal and healthy. 
However, when we get used to unbridled self-expression, we come to believe that all feelings are valid.
We become convinced that in real life, we should also act on our emotions and our impulses.
Using social media this way erodes our ability to regulate our actions and reactions.
To illustrate, when something small irritates us we think that it's okay to feel this way.
But isn't it better to foster one's patience and resilience instead of immediately complaining?
Or when we develop an attraction to someone despite that person being a relationship.
Aand because social media has conditioned us that all feelings can be expressed, we tend to think that acting on this attraction is okay.
Not all feelings deserve expression.
We find ourselves creating our own problems when we let our present emotions control our actions.
